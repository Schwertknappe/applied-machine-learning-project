# Task Description 6
In this exercise, you will compare and visualize the results of the different classification models implemented in Exercise 5. The goal is to synthesize your findings and present a clear comparison of model performance, leading to a discussion of the best approaches for welding quality prediction.

 
## Objectives:
1.  Compile and present the performance metrics of all trained models from Exercise 5 in a structured format.
2.  Create insightful visualizations to compare model performance.
3.  Discuss the results, including the strengths and weaknesses of different models and feature sets.
4.  Conclude with recommendations for the best-performing model(s) and potential future work.

## Tasks:
### Exercise 6.1: Results Compilation
-   Gather all relevant performance metrics for every classifier and feature set combination (engineered features vs. raw time-series) from Exercise 5 and visualize the **top 3 models** in all subsequent tasks.
-   Create one or multiple comprehensive table (e.g., using pandas DataFrame and exporting to Markdown or a similar format) that summarizes these results. The table should clearly show:
    - Classifier name
    - Feature set used (engineered/raw)
    - Performance on each of the chosen evaluation metrics (on the test set)
  
### Exercise 6.2: Results Visualization and Discussion
- Create visualizations to compare the performance of the different models. Examples include:
    - Bar charts comparing key metrics (e.g., F1-score, ROC AUC) across all models and feature sets.
    - Confusion matrices for the best performing models to understand error patterns.
- Discuss the visualizations:
    - Which models performed best overall, and on which feature sets?
    - Were there significant differences in performance between using engineered features and raw time-series data? Why might this be?
    - How do the chosen evaluation metrics reflect the models' ability to distinguish between good and bad quality welds?

### Exercise 6.3: Presentation of Findings
- Present your compiled table, visualizations, and discussion.
- This can be done in:
    - A dedicated Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `ex_06_results_comparison.ipynb`).
    - Or, if preferred, by generating necessary assets (tables, plots) and incorporating them into a GitHub Pages site or a section of your project's `README.md`.
- Ensure your presentation is clear, well-organized, and easy to understand.

### Exercise 6.4: Conclusion and Future Work
- Based on your analysis, draw conclusions about the most effective approaches for classifying welding quality using the tested models and features.
- Suggest potential areas for future work. This could include trying other types of models, more advanced feature engineering, different data preprocessing techniques, or exploring ensemble methods.

## Expected Outcomes:
- A clear, tabular comparison of model performances from Exercise 5.
- Insightful visualizations aiding the comparison of models.
- A thorough discussion of the results, highlighting key findings and trade-offs.
- Well-reasoned conclusions and suggestions for future improvements or research directions.

## Notes:
- Ensure your visualizations are well-labeled and easy to interpret.
- Your discussion should be data-driven, referencing specific results from your table and plots.
- If using GitHub Pages, ensure your plots are saved as image files or html files and embedded correctly, and tables are formatted correctly.
- The goal is to effectively communicate your findings and the relative merits of the different approaches you've tested.
